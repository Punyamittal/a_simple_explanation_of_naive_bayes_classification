# A simple explanation of Naive Bayes Classification

## Problem Description

I am finding it hard to understand the process of Naive Bayes, and I was wondering if someone could explain it with a simple step by step process in English. I understand it takes comparisons by times occurred as a probability, but I have no idea how the training data is related to the actual dataset.
Please give me an explanation of what role the training set plays. I am giving a very simple example for fruits here, like banana for example
training set---
round-red
round-orange
oblong-yellow

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Training

1. Place your dataset as `data.csv`
2. Update the target column name in `train.py`
3. Run:
```bash
python train.py
```
